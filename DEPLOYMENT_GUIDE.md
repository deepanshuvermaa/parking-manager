---

## 📦 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway

```bash
cd C:\Users\Asus\parkease_manager

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Complete auth system with device management and data sync"

# Push to Railway (triggers automatic deployment)
git push origin master
```

**Railway will automatically:**
1. Detect changes and rebuild
2. Run database migrations (`startup-migration.js`)
3. Create `devices`, `sessions`, `user_permissions` tables
4. Add `multi_device_enabled` and `max_devices` columns to `users`
5. Start the server on https://parkease-production-6679.up.railway.app

### Step 2: Verify Backend Deployment

**Monitor Railway Logs:**
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Open your `parkease-production` project
3. Check logs for:
   ```
   🔄 Checking for database migrations...
   ✅ User management migration already applied
   📦 Applying devices and sessions migration...
   ✅ Devices and sessions migration applied successfully
   ✅ Session middleware initialized with database
   🚀 ParkEase Backend Server running on port 5000
   ```

**Test Health Endpoint:**
```bash
curl https://parkease-production-6679.up.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-10-05T..."}
```

### Step 3: Build Flutter App

```bash
cd C:\Users\Asus\parkease_manager

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Clean build
flutter clean

# Build APK for Android
flutter build apk --release

# Or build App Bundle

  s.session_id,
  u.username,
  s.device_id,
  s.is_valid,
  s.expires_at,
  s.last_activity
FROM sessions s
JOIN users u ON s.user_id = u.id
WHERE s.is_valid = true
ORDER BY s.last_activity DESC;
```

### Check Device Registrations
```sql
SELECT
  d.device_name,
  d.platform,
  u.username,
  d.is_active,
  d.is_primary,
  d.last_active_at
FROM devices d
JOIN users u ON d.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY d.last_active_at DESC;
```

### Check User Permissions
```sql
SELECT
  u.username,
  u.role,
  u.multi_device_enabled,
  u.max_devices,
  COUNT(d.id) as device_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN devices d ON d.user_id = u.id AND d.is_active = true
GROUP BY u.id
ORDER BY u.created_at DESC;
```

### Check Staff Members
```sql
SELECT
  staff.username as staff_email,
  staff.full_name,
  staff.role,

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Migration failed" in Railway logs

**Solution:**
```bash
# SSH into Railway and run migrations manually
railway run bash
psql $DATABASE_URL

# Check current migrations
SELECT * FROM schema_migrations;

# If table doesn't exist, create it
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  migration_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  applied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

# Manually run migrations
\i backend/scripts/add-user-management.sql
```

### Issue: "Token validation failed" on app startup

**Possible Causes:**
1. Backend server down
2. Token expired
3. Session deleted from database

**Solution:**
- Check Railway logs
- Verify session exists in database
- Clear app data and login again

### Issue: "Vehicle not syncing to backend"

**Debug:**
1. Check console logs for exact error
2. Verify token is valid
3. Check backend `/api/vehicles` endpoint manually
4. Look at `sync_queue` table in local SQLite

```dart
final stats = await LocalDatabaseService.getStats();
print('Unsynced vehicles: ${stats['unsynced']}');
print('Sync queue: ${stats['queue']}');
```

### Issue: Device limit not enforcing

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT id, username, multi_device_enabled, max_devices
FROM users
WHERE username = 'test@example.com';
```

**Expected:**
- `multi_device_enabled` = false
- `max_devices` = 1
