## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Export/Import Implementation:
- Uses `SharedPreferences.getKeys()` to get ALL keys
- Automatically includes any future settings
- JSON format allows for easy inspection/editing
- Version field allows for migration logic later

### Vehicle Rate Model:
- Immutable with `copyWith` support
- JSON serialization built-in
- Stores as List<String> in SharedPreferences
- Each rate is individually encoded

### Time-Based Pricing Algorithm:
```dart
1. Check if duration <= freeMinutes → Return ₹0
2. Loop through timedRates (sorted by afterHours)
3. If duration.inHours >= rate.afterHours:
   - If flatRate exists → Return flatRate
   - Else if hourlyRate exists → Calculate with that rate
4. If no match → Use base hourlyRate
5. Apply minimumCharge if result < minimum
```
